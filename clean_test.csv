1221-135766-0000,HOW STRANGE IT SEEMED TO THE SAD WOMAN AS SHE WATCHED THE GROWTH AND THE BEAUTY THAT BECAME EVERY DAY MORE BRILLIANT AND THE INTELLIGENCE THAT THREW ITS QUIVERING SUNSHINE OVER THE TINY FEATURES OF THIS CHILD,2
1221-135766-0001,GOD AS A DIRECT CONSEQUENCE OF THE SIN WHICH MAN THUS PUNISHED HAD GIVEN HER A LOVELY CHILD WHOSE PLACE WAS ON THAT SAME DISHONOURED BOSOM TO CONNECT HER PARENT FOR EVER WITH THE RACE AND DESCENT OF MORTALS AND TO BE FINALLY A BLESSED SOUL IN HEAVEN,2
1221-135766-0002,YET THESE THOUGHTS AFFECTED HESTER PRYNNE LESS WITH HOPE THAN APPREHENSION,2
1221-135766-0003,THE CHILD HAD A NATIVE GRACE WHICH DOES NOT INVARIABLY CO EXIST WITH FAULTLESS BEAUTY ITS ATTIRE HOWEVER SIMPLE ALWAYS IMPRESSED THE BEHOLDER AS IF IT WERE THE VERY GARB THAT PRECISELY BECAME IT BEST,2
1221-135766-0004,THIS OUTWARD MUTABILITY INDICATED AND DID NOT MORE THAN FAIRLY EXPRESS THE VARIOUS PROPERTIES OF HER INNER LIFE,2
1221-135766-0005,HESTER COULD ONLY ACCOUNT FOR THE CHILD'S CHARACTER AND EVEN THEN MOST VAGUELY AND IMPERFECTLY BY RECALLING WHAT SHE HERSELF HAD BEEN DURING THAT MOMENTOUS PERIOD WHILE PEARL WAS IMBIBING HER SOUL FROM THE SPIRITUAL WORLD AND HER BODILY FRAME FROM ITS MATERIAL OF EARTH,2
1221-135766-0006,THEY WERE NOW ILLUMINATED BY THE MORNING RADIANCE OF A YOUNG CHILD'S DISPOSITION BUT LATER IN THE DAY OF EARTHLY EXISTENCE MIGHT BE PROLIFIC OF THE STORM AND WHIRLWIND,2
1221-135766-0007,HESTER PRYNNE NEVERTHELESS THE LOVING MOTHER OF THIS ONE CHILD RAN LITTLE RISK OF ERRING ON THE SIDE OF UNDUE SEVERITY,2
1221-135766-0008,MINDFUL HOWEVER OF HER OWN ERRORS AND MISFORTUNES SHE EARLY SOUGHT TO IMPOSE A TENDER BUT STRICT CONTROL OVER THE INFANT IMMORTALITY THAT WAS COMMITTED TO HER CHARGE,2
1221-135766-0009,AS TO ANY OTHER KIND OF DISCIPLINE WHETHER ADDRESSED TO HER MIND OR HEART LITTLE PEARL MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT BE WITHIN ITS REACH IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CAPRICE THAT RULED THE MOMENT,2
1221-135766-0010,IT WAS A LOOK SO INTELLIGENT YET INEXPLICABLE PERVERSE SOMETIMES SO MALICIOUS BUT GENERALLY ACCOMPANIED BY A WILD FLOW OF SPIRITS THAT HESTER COULD NOT HELP QUESTIONING AT SUCH MOMENTS WHETHER PEARL WAS A HUMAN CHILD,2
1221-135766-0011,BEHOLDING IT HESTER WAS CONSTRAINED TO RUSH TOWARDS THE CHILD TO PURSUE THE LITTLE ELF IN THE FLIGHT WHICH SHE INVARIABLY BEGAN TO SNATCH HER TO HER BOSOM WITH A CLOSE PRESSURE AND EARNEST KISSES NOT SO MUCH FROM OVERFLOWING LOVE AS TO ASSURE HERSELF THAT PEARL WAS FLESH AND BLOOD AND NOT UTTERLY DELUSIVE,2
1221-135766-0012,BROODING OVER ALL THESE MATTERS THE MOTHER FELT LIKE ONE WHO HAS EVOKED A SPIRIT BUT BY SOME IRREGULARITY IN THE PROCESS OF CONJURATION HAS FAILED TO WIN THE MASTER WORD THAT SHOULD CONTROL THIS NEW AND INCOMPREHENSIBLE INTELLIGENCE,2
1221-135766-0013,PEARL WAS A BORN OUTCAST OF THE INFANTILE WORLD,2
1221-135766-0014,PEARL SAW AND GAZED INTENTLY BUT NEVER SOUGHT TO MAKE ACQUAINTANCE,2
1221-135766-0015,IF SPOKEN TO SHE WOULD NOT SPEAK AGAIN,2
1320-122612-0000,SINCE THE PERIOD OF OUR TALE THE ACTIVE SPIRIT OF THE COUNTRY HAS SURROUNDED IT WITH A BELT OF RICH AND THRIVING SETTLEMENTS THOUGH NONE BUT THE HUNTER OR THE SAVAGE IS EVER KNOWN EVEN NOW TO PENETRATE ITS WILD RECESSES,3
1320-122612-0001,THE DEWS WERE SUFFERED TO EXHALE AND THE SUN HAD DISPERSED THE MISTS AND WAS SHEDDING A STRONG AND CLEAR LIGHT IN THE FOREST WHEN THE TRAVELERS RESUMED THEIR JOURNEY,3
1320-122612-0002,AFTER PROCEEDING A FEW MILES THE PROGRESS OF HAWKEYE WHO LED THE ADVANCE BECAME MORE DELIBERATE AND WATCHFUL,3
1320-122612-0003,HE OFTEN STOPPED TO EXAMINE THE TREES NOR DID HE CROSS A RIVULET WITHOUT ATTENTIVELY CONSIDERING THE QUANTITY THE VELOCITY AND THE COLOR OF ITS WATERS,3
1320-122612-0004,DISTRUSTING HIS OWN JUDGMENT HIS APPEALS TO THE OPINION OF CHINGACHGOOK WERE FREQUENT AND EARNEST,3
1320-122612-0005,YET HERE ARE WE WITHIN A SHORT RANGE OF THE SCAROONS AND NOT A SIGN OF A TRAIL HAVE WE CROSSED,3
1320-122612-0006,LET US RETRACE OUR STEPS AND EXAMINE AS WE GO WITH KEENER EYES,3
1320-122612-0007,CHINGACHGOOK HAD CAUGHT THE LOOK AND MOTIONING WITH HIS HAND HE BADE HIM SPEAK,3
1320-122612-0008,THE EYES OF THE WHOLE PARTY FOLLOWED THE UNEXPECTED MOVEMENT AND READ THEIR SUCCESS IN THE AIR OF TRIUMPH THAT THE YOUTH ASSUMED,3
1320-122612-0009,IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE WONDERFUL HAD HE SPOKEN WITHOUT A BIDDING,3
1320-122612-0010,SEE SAID UNCAS POINTING NORTH AND SOUTH AT THE EVIDENT MARKS OF THE BROAD TRAIL ON EITHER SIDE OF HIM THE DARK HAIR HAS GONE TOWARD THE FOREST,3
1320-122612-0011,IF A ROCK OR A RIVULET OR A BIT OF EARTH HARDER THAN COMMON SEVERED THE LINKS OF THE CLEW THEY FOLLOWED THE TRUE EYE OF THE SCOUT RECOVERED THEM AT A DISTANCE AND SELDOM RENDERED THE DELAY OF A SINGLE MOMENT NECESSARY,3
1320-122612-0012,EXTINGUISHED BRANDS WERE LYING AROUND A SPRING THE OFFALS OF A DEER WERE SCATTERED ABOUT THE PLACE AND THE TREES BORE EVIDENT MARKS OF HAVING BEEN BROWSED BY THE HORSES,3
1320-122612-0013,A CIRCLE OF A FEW HUNDRED FEET IN CIRCUMFERENCE WAS DRAWN AND EACH OF THE PARTY TOOK A SEGMENT FOR HIS PORTION,3
1320-122612-0014,THE EXAMINATION HOWEVER RESULTED IN NO DISCOVERY,3
1320-122612-0015,THE WHOLE PARTY CROWDED TO THE SPOT WHERE UNCAS POINTED OUT THE IMPRESSION OF A MOCCASIN IN THE MOIST ALLUVION,3
1320-122612-0016,RUN BACK UNCAS AND BRING ME THE SIZE OF THE SINGER'S FOOT,3
1995-1836-0000,THE HON CHARLES SMITH MISS SARAH'S BROTHER WAS WALKING SWIFTLY UPTOWN FROM MISTER EASTERLY'S WALL STREET OFFICE AND HIS FACE WAS PALE,4
1995-1836-0001,AT LAST THE COTTON COMBINE WAS TO ALL APPEARANCES AN ASSURED FACT AND HE WAS SLATED FOR THE SENATE,4
1995-1836-0002,WHY SHOULD HE NOT BE AS OTHER MEN,4
1995-1836-0003,SHE WAS NOT HERSELF A NOTABLY INTELLIGENT WOMAN SHE GREATLY ADMIRED INTELLIGENCE OR WHATEVER LOOKED TO HER LIKE INTELLIGENCE IN OTHERS,4
1995-1836-0004,AS SHE AWAITED HER GUESTS SHE SURVEYED THE TABLE WITH BOTH SATISFACTION AND DISQUIETUDE FOR HER SOCIAL FUNCTIONS WERE FEW TONIGHT THERE WERE SHE CHECKED THEM OFF ON HER FINGERS SIR JAMES CREIGHTON THE RICH ENGLISH MANUFACTURER AND LADY CREIGHTON MISTER AND MISSUS VANDERPOOL MISTER HARRY CRESSWELL AND HIS SISTER JOHN TAYLOR AND HIS SISTER AND MISTER CHARLES SMITH WHOM THE EVENING PAPERS MENTIONED AS LIKELY TO BE UNITED STATES SENATOR FROM NEW JERSEY A SELECTION OF GUESTS THAT HAD BEEN DETERMINED UNKNOWN TO THE HOSTESS BY THE MEETING OF COTTON INTERESTS EARLIER IN THE DAY,4
1995-1836-0005,MISSUS GREY HAD MET SOUTHERNERS BEFORE BUT NOT INTIMATELY AND SHE ALWAYS HAD IN MIND VIVIDLY THEIR CRUELTY TO POOR NEGROES A SUBJECT SHE MADE A POINT OF INTRODUCING FORTHWITH,4
1995-1836-0006,SHE WAS THEREFORE MOST AGREEABLY SURPRISED TO HEAR MISTER CRESSWELL EXPRESS HIMSELF SO CORDIALLY AS APPROVING OF NEGRO EDUCATION,4
1995-1836-0007,BUT YOU BELIEVE IN SOME EDUCATION ASKED MARY TAYLOR,4
1995-1836-0008,I BELIEVE IN THE TRAINING OF PEOPLE TO THEIR HIGHEST CAPACITY THE ENGLISHMAN HERE HEARTILY SECONDED HIM,4
1995-1836-0009,BUT CRESSWELL ADDED SIGNIFICANTLY CAPACITY DIFFERS ENORMOUSLY BETWEEN RACES,4
1995-1836-0010,THE VANDERPOOLS WERE SURE OF THIS AND THE ENGLISHMAN INSTANCING INDIA BECAME QUITE ELOQUENT MISSUS GREY WAS MYSTIFIED BUT HARDLY DARED ADMIT IT THE GENERAL TREND OF THE CONVERSATION SEEMED TO BE THAT MOST INDIVIDUALS NEEDED TO BE SUBMITTED TO THE SHARPEST SCRUTINY BEFORE BEING ALLOWED MUCH EDUCATION AND AS FOR THE LOWER RACES IT WAS SIMPLY CRIMINAL TO OPEN SUCH USELESS OPPORTUNITIES TO THEM,4
1995-1836-0011,POSITIVELY HEROIC ADDED CRESSWELL AVOIDING HIS SISTER'S EYES,4
1995-1836-0012,BUT WE'RE NOT ER EXACTLY WELCOMED,4
1995-1836-0013,MARY TAYLOR HOWEVER RELATED THE TALE OF ZORA TO MISSUS GREY'S PRIVATE EAR LATER,4
1995-1836-0014,FORTUNATELY SAID MISTER VANDERPOOL NORTHERNERS AND SOUTHERNERS ARE ARRIVING AT A BETTER MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING ON MOST OF THESE MATTERS,4
237-126133-0000,HERE SHE WOULD STAY COMFORTED AND SOOTHED AMONG THE LOVELY PLANTS AND RICH EXOTICS REJOICING THE HEART OF OLD TURNER THE GARDENER WHO SINCE POLLY'S FIRST RAPTUROUS ENTRANCE HAD TAKEN HER INTO HIS GOOD GRACES FOR ALL TIME,5
237-126133-0001,EVERY CHANCE SHE COULD STEAL AFTER PRACTICE HOURS WERE OVER AND AFTER THE CLAMOROUS DEMANDS OF THE BOYS UPON HER TIME WERE FULLY SATISFIED WAS SEIZED TO FLY ON THE WINGS OF THE WIND TO THE FLOWERS,5
237-126133-0002,THEN DEAR SAID MISSUS WHITNEY YOU MUST BE KINDER TO HER THAN EVER THINK WHAT IT WOULD BE FOR ONE OF YOU TO BE AWAY FROM HOME EVEN AMONG FRIENDS,5
237-126133-0003,SOMEHOW OF ALL THE DAYS WHEN THE HOME FEELING WAS THE STRONGEST THIS DAY IT SEEMED AS IF SHE COULD BEAR IT NO LONGER,5
237-126133-0004,IF SHE COULD ONLY SEE PHRONSIE FOR JUST ONE MOMENT,5
237-126133-0005,OH SHE'S ALWAYS AT THE PIANO SAID VAN SHE MUST BE THERE NOW SOMEWHERE AND THEN SOMEBODY LAUGHED,5
237-126133-0006,AT THIS THE BUNDLE OPENED SUDDENLY AND OUT POPPED PHRONSIE,5
237-126133-0007,BUT POLLY COULDN'T SPEAK AND IF JASPER HADN'T CAUGHT HER JUST IN TIME SHE WOULD HAVE TUMBLED OVER BACKWARD FROM THE STOOL PHRONSIE AND ALL,5
237-126133-0008,ASKED PHRONSIE WITH HER LITTLE FACE CLOSE TO POLLY'S OWN,5
237-126133-0009,NOW YOU'LL STAY CRIED VAN SAY POLLY WON'T YOU,5
237-126133-0010,OH YOU ARE THE DEAREST AND BEST MISTER KING I EVER SAW BUT HOW DID YOU MAKE MAMMY LET HER COME,5
237-126133-0011,ISN'T HE SPLENDID CRIED JASPER IN INTENSE PRIDE SWELLING UP FATHER KNEW HOW TO DO IT,5
237-126133-0012,THERE THERE HE SAID SOOTHINGLY PATTING HER BROWN FUZZY HEAD,5
237-126133-0013,I KNOW GASPED POLLY CONTROLLING HER SOBS I WON'T ONLY I CAN'T THANK YOU,5
237-126133-0014,ASKED PHRONSIE IN INTENSE INTEREST SLIPPING DOWN OUT OF POLLY'S ARMS AND CROWDING UP CLOSE TO JASPER'S SIDE,5
237-126133-0015,YES ALL ALONE BY HIMSELF ASSERTED JASPER VEHEMENTLY AND WINKING FURIOUSLY TO THE OTHERS TO STOP THEIR LAUGHING HE DID NOW TRULY PHRONSIE,5
237-126133-0016,OH NO JASPER I MUST GO BY MY VERY OWN SELF,5
237-126133-0017,THERE JAP YOU'VE CAUGHT IT LAUGHED PERCY WHILE THE OTHERS SCREAMED AT THE SIGHT OF JASPER'S FACE,5
237-126133-0018,DON'T MIND IT POLLY WHISPERED JASPER TWASN'T HER FAULT,5
237-126133-0019,DEAR ME EJACULATED THE OLD GENTLEMAN IN THE UTMOST AMAZEMENT AND SUCH A TIME AS I'VE HAD TO GET HER HERE TOO,5
237-126133-0020,HOW DID HER MOTHER EVER LET HER GO,5
237-126133-0021,SHE ASKED IMPULSIVELY I DIDN'T BELIEVE YOU COULD PERSUADE HER FATHER,5
237-126133-0022,I DIDN'T HAVE ANY FEARS IF I WORKED IT RIGHTLY SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN COMPLACENTLY,5
237-126133-0023,HE CRIED IN HIGH DUDGEON JUST AS IF HE OWNED THE WHOLE OF THE PEPPERS AND COULD DISPOSE OF THEM ALL TO SUIT HIS FANCY,5
237-126133-0024,AND THE OLD GENTLEMAN WAS SO DELIGHTED WITH HIS SUCCESS THAT HE HAD TO BURST OUT INTO A SERIES OF SHORT HAPPY BITS OF LAUGHTER THAT OCCUPIED QUITE A SPACE OF TIME,5
237-126133-0025,AT LAST HE CAME OUT OF THEM AND WIPED HIS FACE VIGOROUSLY,5
260-123286-0000,SATURDAY AUGUST FIFTEENTH THE SEA UNBROKEN ALL ROUND NO LAND IN SIGHT,6
260-123286-0001,THE HORIZON SEEMS EXTREMELY DISTANT,6
260-123286-0002,ALL MY DANGER AND SUFFERINGS WERE NEEDED TO STRIKE A SPARK OF HUMAN FEELING OUT OF HIM BUT NOW THAT I AM WELL HIS NATURE HAS RESUMED ITS SWAY,6
260-123286-0003,YOU SEEM ANXIOUS MY UNCLE I SAID SEEING HIM CONTINUALLY WITH HIS GLASS TO HIS EYE ANXIOUS,6
260-123286-0004,ONE MIGHT BE WITH LESS REASON THAN NOW,6
260-123286-0005,I AM NOT COMPLAINING THAT THE RATE IS SLOW BUT THAT THE SEA IS SO WIDE,6
260-123286-0006,WE ARE LOSING TIME AND THE FACT IS I HAVE NOT COME ALL THIS WAY TO TAKE A LITTLE SAIL UPON A POND ON A RAFT,6
260-123286-0007,HE CALLED THIS SEA A POND AND OUR LONG VOYAGE TAKING A LITTLE SAIL,6
260-123286-0008,THEREFORE DON'T TALK TO ME ABOUT VIEWS AND PROSPECTS,6
260-123286-0009,I TAKE THIS AS MY ANSWER AND I LEAVE THE PROFESSOR TO BITE HIS LIPS WITH IMPATIENCE,6
260-123286-0010,SUNDAY AUGUST SIXTEENTH,6
260-123286-0011,NOTHING NEW WEATHER UNCHANGED THE WIND FRESHENS,6
260-123286-0012,BUT THERE SEEMED NO REASON TO FEAR,6
260-123286-0013,THE SHADOW OF THE RAFT WAS CLEARLY OUTLINED UPON THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES,6
260-123286-0014,TRULY THIS SEA IS OF INFINITE WIDTH,6
260-123286-0015,IT MUST BE AS WIDE AS THE MEDITERRANEAN OR THE ATLANTIC AND WHY NOT,6
260-123286-0016,THESE THOUGHTS AGITATED ME ALL DAY AND MY IMAGINATION SCARCELY CALMED DOWN AFTER SEVERAL HOURS SLEEP,6
260-123286-0017,I SHUDDER AS I RECALL THESE MONSTERS TO MY REMEMBRANCE,6
260-123286-0018,I SAW AT THE HAMBURG MUSEUM THE SKELETON OF ONE OF THESE CREATURES THIRTY FEET IN LENGTH,6
260-123286-0019,I SUPPOSE PROFESSOR LIEDENBROCK WAS OF MY OPINION TOO AND EVEN SHARED MY FEARS FOR AFTER HAVING EXAMINED THE PICK HIS EYES TRAVERSED THE OCEAN FROM SIDE TO SIDE,6
260-123286-0020,TUESDAY AUGUST EIGHTEENTH,6
260-123286-0021,DURING HIS WATCH I SLEPT,6
260-123286-0022,TWO HOURS AFTERWARDS A TERRIBLE SHOCK AWOKE ME,6
260-123286-0023,THE RAFT WAS HEAVED UP ON A WATERY MOUNTAIN AND PITCHED DOWN AGAIN AT A DISTANCE OF TWENTY FATHOMS,6
260-123286-0024,THERE'S A WHALE A WHALE CRIED THE PROFESSOR,6
260-123286-0025,FLIGHT WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION NOW THE REPTILES ROSE THEY WHEELED AROUND OUR LITTLE RAFT WITH A RAPIDITY GREATER THAN THAT OF EXPRESS TRAINS,6
260-123286-0026,TWO MONSTERS ONLY WERE CREATING ALL THIS COMMOTION AND BEFORE MY EYES ARE TWO REPTILES OF THE PRIMITIVE WORLD,6
260-123286-0027,I CAN DISTINGUISH THE EYE OF THE ICHTHYOSAURUS GLOWING LIKE A RED HOT COAL AND AS LARGE AS A MAN'S HEAD,6
260-123286-0028,ITS JAW IS ENORMOUS AND ACCORDING TO NATURALISTS IT IS ARMED WITH NO LESS THAN ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY TWO TEETH,6
260-123286-0029,THOSE HUGE CREATURES ATTACKED EACH OTHER WITH THE GREATEST ANIMOSITY,6
260-123286-0030,SUDDENLY THE ICHTHYOSAURUS AND THE PLESIOSAURUS DISAPPEAR BELOW LEAVING A WHIRLPOOL EDDYING IN THE WATER,6
260-123286-0031,AS FOR THE ICHTHYOSAURUS HAS HE RETURNED TO HIS SUBMARINE CAVERN,6
2830-3979-0000,WE WANT YOU TO HELP US PUBLISH SOME LEADING WORK OF LUTHER'S FOR THE GENERAL AMERICAN MARKET WILL YOU DO IT,7
2830-3979-0001,THE CONDITION IS THAT I WILL BE PERMITTED TO MAKE LUTHER TALK AMERICAN STREAMLINE HIM SO TO SPEAK BECAUSE YOU WILL NEVER GET PEOPLE WHETHER IN OR OUTSIDE THE LUTHERAN CHURCH ACTUALLY TO READ LUTHER UNLESS WE MAKE HIM TALK AS HE WOULD TALK TODAY TO AMERICANS,7
2830-3979-0002,LET US BEGIN WITH THAT HIS COMMENTARY ON GALATIANS,7
2830-3979-0003,THE UNDERTAKING WHICH SEEMED SO ATTRACTIVE WHEN VIEWED AS A LITERARY TASK PROVED A MOST DIFFICULT ONE AND AT TIMES BECAME OPPRESSIVE,7
2830-3979-0004,IT WAS WRITTEN IN LATIN,7
2830-3979-0005,THE WORK HAD TO BE CONDENSED,7
2830-3979-0006,A WORD SHOULD NOW BE SAID ABOUT THE ORIGIN OF LUTHER'S COMMENTARY ON GALATIANS,7
2830-3979-0007,MUCH LATER WHEN A FRIEND OF HIS WAS PREPARING AN EDITION OF ALL HIS LATIN WORKS HE REMARKED TO HIS HOME CIRCLE IF I HAD MY WAY ABOUT IT THEY WOULD REPUBLISH ONLY THOSE OF MY BOOKS WHICH HAVE DOCTRINE MY GALATIANS FOR INSTANCE,7
2830-3979-0008,IN OTHER WORDS THESE THREE MEN TOOK DOWN THE LECTURES WHICH LUTHER ADDRESSED TO HIS STUDENTS IN THE COURSE OF GALATIANS AND ROERER PREPARED THE MANUSCRIPT FOR THE PRINTER,7
2830-3979-0009,IT PRESENTS LIKE NO OTHER OF LUTHER'S WRITINGS THE CENTRAL THOUGHT OF CHRISTIANITY THE JUSTIFICATION OF THE SINNER FOR THE SAKE OF CHRIST'S MERITS ALONE,7
2830-3979-0010,BUT THE ESSENCE OF LUTHER'S LECTURES IS THERE,7
2830-3979-0011,THE LORD WHO HAS GIVEN US POWER TO TEACH AND TO HEAR LET HIM ALSO GIVE US THE POWER TO SERVE AND TO DO LUKE TWO,7
2830-3979-0012,THE WORD OF OUR GOD SHALL STAND FOREVER,7
3570-5695-0000,IN A GENERAL WAY THOUGH NOT WHOLLY NOR CONSISTENTLY THESE TWO GROUPS COINCIDE,8
3570-5695-0001,THE DEPENDENT WHO WAS FIRST DELEGATED FOR THESE DUTIES WAS THE WIFE OR THE CHIEF WIFE AND AS WOULD BE EXPECTED IN THE LATER DEVELOPMENT OF THE INSTITUTION WHEN THE NUMBER OF PERSONS BY WHOM THESE DUTIES ARE CUSTOMARILY PERFORMED GRADUALLY NARROWS THE WIFE REMAINS THE LAST,8
3570-5695-0002,BUT AS WE DESCEND THE SOCIAL SCALE THE POINT IS PRESENTLY REACHED WHERE THE DUTIES OF VICARIOUS LEISURE AND CONSUMPTION DEVOLVE UPON THE WIFE ALONE,8
3570-5695-0003,IN THE COMMUNITIES OF THE WESTERN CULTURE THIS POINT IS AT PRESENT FOUND AMONG THE LOWER MIDDLE CLASS,8
3570-5695-0004,IF BEAUTY OR COMFORT IS ACHIEVED AND IT IS A MORE OR LESS FORTUITOUS CIRCUMSTANCE IF THEY ARE THEY MUST BE ACHIEVED BY MEANS AND METHODS THAT COMMEND THEMSELVES TO THE GREAT ECONOMIC LAW OF WASTED EFFORT,8
3570-5695-0005,THE MAN OF THE HOUSEHOLD ALSO CAN DO SOMETHING IN THIS DIRECTION AND INDEED HE COMMONLY DOES BUT WITH A STILL LOWER DESCENT INTO THE LEVELS OF INDIGENCE ALONG THE MARGIN OF THE SLUMS THE MAN AND PRESENTLY ALSO THE CHILDREN VIRTUALLY CEASE TO CONSUME VALUABLE GOODS FOR APPEARANCES AND THE WOMAN REMAINS VIRTUALLY THE SOLE EXPONENT OF THE HOUSEHOLD'S PECUNIARY DECENCY,8
3570-5695-0006,VERY MUCH OF SQUALOR AND DISCOMFORT WILL BE ENDURED BEFORE THE LAST TRINKET OR THE LAST PRETENSE OF PECUNIARY DECENCY IS PUT AWAY,8
3570-5695-0007,THERE IS NO CLASS AND NO COUNTRY THAT HAS YIELDED SO ABJECTLY BEFORE THE PRESSURE OF PHYSICAL WANT AS TO DENY THEMSELVES ALL GRATIFICATION OF THIS HIGHER OR SPIRITUAL NEED,8
3570-5695-0008,THE QUESTION IS WHICH OF THE TWO METHODS WILL MOST EFFECTIVELY REACH THE PERSONS WHOSE CONVICTIONS IT IS DESIRED TO AFFECT,8
3570-5695-0009,EACH WILL THEREFORE SERVE ABOUT EQUALLY WELL DURING THE EARLIER STAGES OF SOCIAL GROWTH,8
3570-5695-0010,THE MODERN ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRY WORKS IN THE SAME DIRECTION ALSO BY ANOTHER LINE,8
3570-5695-0011,IT IS EVIDENT THEREFORE THAT THE PRESENT TREND OF THE DEVELOPMENT IS IN THE DIRECTION OF HEIGHTENING THE UTILITY OF CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION AS COMPARED WITH LEISURE,8
3570-5695-0012,IT IS ALSO NOTICEABLE THAT THE SERVICEABILITY OF CONSUMPTION AS A MEANS OF REPUTE AS WELL AS THE INSISTENCE ON IT AS AN ELEMENT OF DECENCY IS AT ITS BEST IN THOSE PORTIONS OF THE COMMUNITY WHERE THE HUMAN CONTACT OF THE INDIVIDUAL IS WIDEST AND THE MOBILITY OF THE POPULATION IS GREATEST,8
3570-5695-0013,CONSUMPTION BECOMES A LARGER ELEMENT IN THE STANDARD OF LIVING IN THE CITY THAN IN THE COUNTRY,8
3570-5695-0014,AMONG THE COUNTRY POPULATION ITS PLACE IS TO SOME EXTENT TAKEN BY SAVINGS AND HOME COMFORTS KNOWN THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF NEIGHBORHOOD GOSSIP SUFFICIENTLY TO SERVE THE LIKE GENERAL PURPOSE OF PECUNIARY REPUTE,8
3570-5695-0015,THE RESULT IS A GREAT MOBILITY OF THE LABOR EMPLOYED IN PRINTING PERHAPS GREATER THAN IN ANY OTHER EQUALLY WELL DEFINED AND CONSIDERABLE BODY OF WORKMEN,8
61-70968-0000,HE BEGAN A CONFUSED COMPLAINT AGAINST THE WIZARD WHO HAD VANISHED BEHIND THE CURTAIN ON THE LEFT,9
61-70968-0001,GIVE NOT SO EARNEST A MIND TO THESE MUMMERIES CHILD,9
61-70968-0002,A GOLDEN FORTUNE AND A HAPPY LIFE,9
61-70968-0003,HE WAS LIKE UNTO MY FATHER IN A WAY AND YET WAS NOT MY FATHER,9
61-70968-0004,ALSO THERE WAS A STRIPLING PAGE WHO TURNED INTO A MAID,9
61-70968-0005,THIS WAS SO SWEET A LADY SIR AND IN SOME MANNER I DO THINK SHE DIED,9
61-70968-0006,BUT THEN THE PICTURE WAS GONE AS QUICKLY AS IT CAME,9
61-70968-0007,SISTER NELL DO YOU HEAR THESE MARVELS,9
61-70968-0008,TAKE YOUR PLACE AND LET US SEE WHAT THE CRYSTAL CAN SHOW TO YOU,9
61-70968-0009,LIKE AS NOT YOUNG MASTER THOUGH I AM AN OLD MAN,9
61-70968-0010,FORTHWITH ALL RAN TO THE OPENING OF THE TENT TO SEE WHAT MIGHT BE AMISS BUT MASTER WILL WHO PEEPED OUT FIRST NEEDED NO MORE THAN ONE GLANCE,9
61-70968-0011,HE GAVE WAY TO THE OTHERS VERY READILY AND RETREATED UNPERCEIVED BY THE SQUIRE AND MISTRESS FITZOOTH TO THE REAR OF THE TENT,9
61-70968-0012,CRIES OF A NOTTINGHAM A NOTTINGHAM,9
61-70968-0013,BEFORE THEM FLED THE STROLLER AND HIS THREE SONS CAPLESS AND TERRIFIED,9
61-70968-0014,WHAT IS THE TUMULT AND RIOTING CRIED OUT THE SQUIRE AUTHORITATIVELY AND HE BLEW TWICE ON A SILVER WHISTLE WHICH HUNG AT HIS BELT,9
61-70968-0015,NAY WE REFUSED THEIR REQUEST MOST POLITELY MOST NOBLE SAID THE LITTLE STROLLER,9
61-70968-0016,AND THEN THEY BECAME VEXED AND WOULD HAVE SNATCHED YOUR PURSE FROM US,9
61-70968-0017,I COULD NOT SEE MY BOY INJURED EXCELLENCE FOR BUT DOING HIS DUTY AS ONE OF CUMBERLAND'S SONS,9
61-70968-0018,SO I DID PUSH THIS FELLOW,9
61-70968-0019,IT IS ENOUGH SAID GEORGE GAMEWELL SHARPLY AND HE TURNED UPON THE CROWD,9
61-70968-0020,SHAME ON YOU CITIZENS CRIED HE I BLUSH FOR MY FELLOWS OF NOTTINGHAM,9
61-70968-0021,SURELY WE CAN SUBMIT WITH GOOD GRACE,9
